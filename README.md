# Sample Website

This is a saMple website made as part of [*Learn Enoug™ HTML to Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/html-tutorial), possibly the greatest beginer HTML tutorial in the history of the Universe. You should totally [check it out](https://www.learnenough.com/html-tutorial).

Appropriately enough, there are lots of HTML tutorials on the Web, but most of them use toy examples, focusing on HTML syntax in isolation, without showing how HTML is written and deployed in real life. In contrast, [*Learn Enoug™ HTML to Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/html-tutorial) not only shows you how to make real HTML pages, it shows you how to deploy an actual site to the live Web.
